# Applied Programming Final Project (Knight Game)
Knight Game is a side-scrolling shooter about a knight that is on a quest to regain his sword. The player must dodge projectiles from the hooded “evil archers”, strategically returning fire with arrows of their own. Arrows are scarce, forcing the player to take cover and aim carefully. Flaming arrows do extra damage, but are even harder to find than regular arrows. Also standing in the player’s way are slimes, which also happen to shoot arrows because of ~~a bug~~ design decisions.
